#List of things to come

- add proper JSON error messages sent to the callbacks on all functions (like get_charge_state does now).
- add a more flexible way to define the order of the streaming output (not always timestamp first)
- add a --kml option to the streaming.js app to output directly to KML format for Google Earth
- publish the message queueing capability for the streaming API
- flush of the other "screens" of a full ASCII app (climate control, lock/unlock, etc.)
- record YouTube video explaining how to install and configure for time of day, scheduled charging
